TOP Grid based layout and design project

# Description  
The goal of this project was to use CSS Grid as much as possible to  
set up a layout for an "admin dashboard" page based on a design  
reference image provided by The Odin Project. I attempted to match  
the design reference as closely as I could, although I struggled  
greatly in some areas. Whatever success I did have was ultimately  
the result of the power of combining both Grid and Flexbox.

NOTE! This page layout is NOT responsive. It WILL look bad on mobile devices!
